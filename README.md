🎓 **Student Performance Prediction Models (KNN vs Linear Regression)**

An end-to-end regression analysis project comparing KNN and Linear Regression models on student performance data using Python and scikit-learn.

This project compares K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Linear Regression models to predict student performance based on key academic factors. It includes clean, reproducible steps for data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, visualization, and evaluation—ideal for coursework, research, and portfolio demonstration.

📘 **Overview**

The notebook walks through: • Data preprocessing and feature scaling • Train-test split and evaluation metrics • Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV • Model comparison between KNN and Linear Regression • Visualization of predicted vs. actual results Both models are built and evaluated using Python and scikit-learn.

🚀 **How to Run the Project**

1️⃣ Clone or Download

git clone : https://github.com/<your-username>/student-performance-prediction-models.git
cd student-performance-prediction-models

2️⃣ Set Up the Environment

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Launch the Notebook

jupyter notebook


Then open Assignment3_KNN-1-1-1.ipynb and run all cells.

📊 **Evaluation Metrics**

Models are compared using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R² Score, and visual comparison of Predicted vs. Actual values.

🧠 **Insights**

• KNN performs well on nonlinear relationships but is sensitive to feature scaling.


• Linear Regression provides interpretability and stable results on linear data.


• Comparing both highlights the trade-off between interpretability and flexibility.
